This sample app demonstrates how to add WMS-layers to a VIKTOR app.

The goal of this app is to demonstrate how to add a WMS-layer to a map. This app was developed using the open-source libraries Leaflet, Folium and OWSLib. Leaflet is a powerful open-source JavaScript library to create interactive maps. Folium is a Python Leaflet-wrapper, which enables to use Leaflet without the use of JavaScript. OWSLib is used to obtain information from the WMS-layer.

In this application the following functionalities are demonstrated:

- Retrieve information from a WMS-layer
- Add WMS-layer to a map

A published version of this app is available on [demo.viktor.ai](demo.viktor.ai/public/wms-app).
